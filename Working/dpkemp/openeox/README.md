# OpenEoX Schema Examples

## OpenEoX TC core schema (Sep 14, 2025):
https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/tree/main/eox-core-v-1-0/schema

### Initial Information model translated from JSON Schema:
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "package": "https://docs.oasis-open.org/openeox/v1.0/schema/core/",
    "jadn_version": "http://oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v2.0/schema/",
    "title": "EoX Information - Core",
    "description": "The schema for representing End-of-Life (EoL), End-of-Security-Support (EoSSec) and other End-of information in OpenEoX.",
    "roots": ["Root"]
  },

  "types": [
    ["Root", "Record", [], "The schema for representing End-of-Life (EoL), End-of-Security-Support (EoSSec) and other End-of information in OpenEoX.", [
      [1, "$schema", "String", [], "Specifies the schema the JSON object must be valid against."],
      [2, "end_of_life", "eox_timestamp_t", [], "Indicates the last day when the particular product is officially supported in any way by the vendor."],
      [3, "end_of_sales", "eox_timestamp_t", ["[0"], "Indicates the last day when a particular product may be ordered by customers from vendor sales channels."],
      [4, "end_of_security_support", "eox_timestamp_t", [], "Indicates the last day when the vendor has committed to providing security remediations for the particular product."],
      [5, "last_updated", "String", [], "Contains the RFC 3339 timestamp when the record was last updated."]
    ]],

    ["eox_timestamp_t", "String", [], "Contains the timestamp at which the product reaches the specified stage or the indicator that this is still 'to be announced'."]
  ]
}
```
* Note that JSON Schema does not define a name for the EoX type, so IM translater assigns it the name "Root".
JSON Schema should define the "EoX" object in `$defs` so that it has a name.

* The schema identifier is an arbitrary string. It should be defined as a string with `/uri` format
because it refers to the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/draft-bhutton-json-schema-01#name-the-id-keyword)
`$id` "https://docs.oasis-open.org/openeox/v1.0/schema/core.json".

* The information model uses a `package` namespace (URI): "https://docs.oasis-open.org/openeox/v1.0/schema/core/",
not a URL of a file, because the identical IM can be defined in multiple file formats.

* The JSON Schema eox_timestamp_t type is `oneOf` /date-time format or the fixed string "tba".  The IM translator did
not process the `oneOf` directive and the examples will be edited to include it in the recommended IM. 

* The use of "_t" or "_type" suffixes to denote types is awkward and hard to read. A naming convention that uses lower-case
for properties and upper-case names for types is more standard and more readable.  In this example, `eox_timestamp_t`
would be named something like `EoxTimestamp` or `EoX_Timestamp`, and if there were a separate `end_of_life` type
it could be named `End_Of_Life` or `EndOfLife`.

   4 end_of_security_support eox_timestamp_t     // Indicates the last day when the vendor has committed to providing security remediations for the particular product.
